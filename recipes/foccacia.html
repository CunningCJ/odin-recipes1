   This may be the fastest yeast bread you make; 
   it takes only one hour from conception to completion. 
   <p><ul>
    <li>1 tablespoon honey </li>
    <li>2 cups warm water </li>
    <li>1 tablespoon active dry yeast </li>
    <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt </li>
    <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil </li>
    <li>5 cups all-purpose flour, or as needed </li>
    <li>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil </li>
    <li>2 tablespoons fresh chopped rosemary </li>
    <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
   </ul></p>
   <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>
   <ol>
    <li>Dissolve honey in the warm water in a large bowl, then sprinkle yeast over the top. Let stand for 5 minutes until the yeast softens and begins to foam. Stir in 1 tablespoon of salt, 1 tablespoon olive oil, onions, and 5 cups of flour until the dough comes together. Knead on a well floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Lightly oil a large bowl, place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 215 degrees C</li>
    <li>Place dough onto oiled baking sheet, and flatten to cover the whole sheet evenly. Use the tips of your fingers to make indentations all over the dough spaced about 1 inch apart. Drizzle the focaccia with 3 tablespoons olive oil, then sprinkle rosemary, Parmesan cheese, and remaining 1 tablespoon of kosher salt over the top. Let rise for 10 minutes</li>
    <li>Bake in preheated oven 20 minutes until golden brown.</li>
